## Commit Messages

A diff is showing what changed. Your git commit message is the best way to communicate to your team. 
To tell them why something changed please always make sure your commit message consistsof the following
three distinct parts separated by a blank line

- typo / subject (limit line to 50 character max)
- body (wrap the body at 72 characters, explain what has changed and why)
- footer (optional, used to reference issues via ID)
